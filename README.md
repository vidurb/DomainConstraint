This is a fork of [phenaproxima](https://github.com/phenaproxima/DomainConstraint)'s DomainConstraint that I'm hoping to keep updated.
# DomainConstraint
A constraint for Symfony's Validator component to test if a value is a valid domain name.

The value is tested against the rules at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#Restrictions_on_valid_host_names

* At least two period-delimited segments
* Cannot start or end with a period
* Each segment must be between 1 and 63 characters
* The entire thing is no greater than 255 characters
* Valid characters are 'a' to 'z', 'A' to 'Z', '0' to '9', and hyphen (-)
* Labels cannot start or end with a hyphen
* The last segment must be a support top-level domains (and there are a LOT of strange ones)
